# GeoBikes

GeoBikes is a collection of types and functions to transform [JCDecaux][1]
public bikes' open data into the [GeoJSON][2] format. This is useful if you're
working with [Mapbox][3] or any other service that uses GeoJSON.

There's a working example in the `cmd` directory. The library is in early
stages, it may change in the future.
